    // 2. Verify the token.

    // For this simulation, since we cannot securely know which user is making the request
    // on the server-side without a real auth token, we'll return a mock "Admin" user
    // to allow the protected operations to proceed. 
    // THIS IS INSECURE and for demonstration purposes only.
    // You should replace this with a proper authentication mechanism.
    
    // A better simulation would require more complex state management or passing a user ID
    // in a custom header, but that's beyond the scope of this simple setup.
    // For now, let's assume any server-side check is done by an authorized user.
